I strive to communicate the findings of my research to a wide audience.

Read below a sort-of a diary describing about some of the outreach opportunities I had over
the past years.

## Radio, The Conversation, and other activities

On August 2018 me and Jeffrey Parker published a paper providing a potential explanation for 
mysterious the discoveries of _Juno_ regarding the depth-extent of the Jupiter's stripes. 
I summarized our findings in a piece at [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/jupiters-magnetic-fields-may-stop-its-wind-bands-from-going-deep-into-the-gas-giant-101324){:target="_blank"}. 
Our findings attracted lots of media attention and in the weeks that followed I gave a few 
radio interviews discussing them.

On April 2021 our [research regarding trends in ocean eddies came out](../publications/global-eke-trends.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 
I was invited to write up a little piece about our findings in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/satellites-reveal-ocean-currents-are-getting-stronger-with-potentially-significant-implications-for-climate-change-159461){:target="_blank"} 
and following that, there were several radio interview requests.

I enjoyed a lot, e.g., the chat I had with [Ruth](https://eastsidefm.org/mondaydrive/){:target="_blank"}:

I often join the [Breakfast show by Simon Lauder](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/southeastnsw/programs/breakfast/){:target="_blank"} 
at [ABC South East NSW](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/southeastnsw/){:target="_blank"} and discuss 
about ocean-related issues.

For example, in April 2021 we chatted about our findings regarding ocean eddy trends:

Four weeks later, I followed up a question that a listener had sent to the show. The listener
was wondering why sometimes at the New South Wales coast despite that warm winds blow from the
North the water temperature can drop dramatically.

An other day we chatted a bit about tides:

In August 2021, I was part of the Atlas of Life South Coast National Science Week (Aug. 13th-21st, 2021).
I gave a lecture on August 14th titled “The ocean currents in a changing climate” as part of 
the symposium [“Our East Australian Ocean Hotspot -- What is it and how will it change our coastal ecology”](https://atlasoflife.org.au/science-week-2021-presentations/#Navid/){:target="_blank"}. (Both the [slides](../presentations/SapphireCoastEACSymposium_Aug2021.pdf){:target="_blank"} and the [recording](https://youtu.be/Xib_t66Mqt8?t=421){:target="_blank"} of the presentation are available.)

On June 2021 I started working on my [DECRA project][decra2021]{:target="_blank"} that involves
use of machine learning algorithms to enhance climate and ocean models. I wrote up a piece in
[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/how-machine-lbearning-is-helping-us-fine-tune-climate-models-to-reach-unprecedented-detail-165818){:target="_blank"} explaining how machine learning
can help in climate science. Next time I was on Simon's show we talked about this.
