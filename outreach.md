I strive to communicate the findings of my research to as wide audience as possible.

## Radio & The Conversation

On August 2018 me and Jeffrey Parker published a paper providing a potential explanation for 
mysterious the discoveries of _Juno_ regarding the depth-extent of the zonal jets in Jupiter. 
I summarized our findings in a piece at [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/jupiters-magnetic-fields-may-stop-its-wind-bands-from-going-deep-into-the-gas-giant-101324){:target="_blank"}. 
Our findings attracted lots of media attention and in the weeks that followed I gave a few 
radio interviews about our findings.

On April 2021 our [research regarding trends in ocean eddies came out](../publications/global-eke-trends.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 
I was invited to write up a little piece about our findings in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/satellites-reveal-ocean-currents-are-getting-stronger-with-potentially-significant-implications-for-climate-change-159461){:target="_blank"} 
and following that, there were several radio interview request. For example, I enjoyed a lot 
chatting with [Ruth](https://eastsidefm.org/mondaydrive/){:target="_blank"}:

I often join the [Breakfast show by Simon Lauder](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/southeastnsw/programs/breakfast/){:target="_blank"} 
at [ABC South East NSW](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/southeastnsw/){:target="_blank"} and discuss 
about ocean-related issues.

For example, in April 2021 we chatted about the findings regarding ocean eddy trends:

Four weeks later, I followed up a question that a listener had sent asking. The listener was
wondering why at the coast of New South Wales the water temperature can drop dramatically when 
warm winds blows from the North.
