On August 2018 me and Jeffrey Parker published a paper providing a potential explanation for mysterious the discoveries of _Juno_ regarding the depth-extent of the zonal jets in Jupiter. I summarized our
findings in a piece at [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/jupiters-magnetic-fields-may-stop-its-wind-bands-from-going-deep-into-the-gas-giant-101324){:target="_blank"}. Our findings attracted lots
of media attention and in the weeks that followed I gave a few radio interviews about our findings.

I often join the [Breakfast show by Simon Lauder](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/southeastnsw/programs/breakfast/){:target="_blank"} at [ABC South East NSW](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/southeastnsw/){:target="_blank"} and chat about ocean-related issues.

For example, in April 2021 we chatted about some [research piece that had just came out](../publications/global-eke-trends.pdf){:target="_blank"}:

Four weeks later, I followed up a question by a listener who was asking for an explanation
for why water temperatures can drop dramatically at the coast of New South Wales when warm
winds blows from the North:
