I am a physicist by education and a geophysical fluid dynamicist at heart.

I grew up in [Lefkosia][lefkosia-site] and then I headed off to Greece to study at the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens][uoa-site]. I obtained my Ph.D. on Physics in March 2015
under the supervision of [Petros J. Ioannou][pji-site]. My Ph.D. research revolved around
atmospheric dynamics and flows on planetary atmospheres. From September 2015 until April 2018,
I worked as a [NOAA Climate & Global Change][noaa-site] postdoctoral fellow with
[Bill Young][bill-site] at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography][scripps-site],
[University of California San Diego][ucsd-site]. At Scripps I started studying flows beneath
the ocean's surface, focussing on dynamical processes that are at play in the ocean. Then, on
May 2018, I moved down under at the [Australian National University][anu-site]. I joined the
[ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes][arc-site] as a [Research Fellow][arc-profile]
working mainly with [Andy Hogg][andy-site]. On November 2020, I received a [Discovery Early Career Researcher Award][decra2021] from the Australian Research Council to work on machine learning
and ocean eddy parametrizations, a project that started on June 2021.

Besides research I enjoy surfing 🏄🏽, biking 🚲, horse riding 🐎, and dancing 💃🏼. I also like
telling stories (science-related or not) and I am an avid story listener. Whenever I get the
chance I hop into the ocean in person.

Have a look at my [vitae (CV)][cv-pdf] or read more about my [research](../research/).
