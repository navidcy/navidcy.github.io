#subtitle: Short biographical note
---


After growing up in the city of [Lefkosia][lefkosia-site] I headed off to Greece to study physics at the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens][uoa-site]. I obtained my Ph.D. in March 2015 under the supervision of [Petros J. Ioannou][pji-site] on atmospheric dynamics and specifically on the formation of large-scale structures in planetary atmospheres. Since September 2015, I am working as a [NOAA Climate & Global Change][noaa-site] postdoctoral fellow with [Bill Young][bill-site] at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography][scripps-site], [University of California San Diego][ucsd-site]. Beginning May 2018, I will be going down under to join the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes][arc-site] project as a Research Fellow. I will be mainly working with [Andy Hogg][andy-site] at the [Australian National University][anu-site].
