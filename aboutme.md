I am a physicist by education and a geophysical fluid dynamicist at heart.

I grew up in [Lefkosia][lefkosia-site] and then I headed off to Greece to study at the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens][uoa-site].
I obtained my Ph.D. on Physics in March 2015 under the supervision of [Petros J. Ioannou][pji-site].
My Ph.D. research revolved around atmospheric dynamics and flows on planetary atmospheres.
From September 2015 until April 2018, I worked as a [NOAA Climate & Global Change][noaa-site] postdoctoral fellow with
[Bill Young][bill-site] at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography][scripps-site],
[University of California San Diego][ucsd-site].
At Scripps I started studying flows beneath the ocean's surface, focussing on dynamical processes that are at play in the ocean.
On May 2018, I moved down under at the [Australian National University][anu-site] where I joined the
[ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes][arc-site] as a Research Fellow
working mainly with [Andy Hogg][andy-site].
After that, on 2021 I transitioned to a [Discovery Early Career Researcher Award][decra2021] Research Fellow working on ocean eddy parametrizations and also heavily involved in [ocean model development][oceananigans-repo] in collaboration with the [Climate Modelling Alliance][clima-site].

Since June 2024, I am a [Senior Lecturer](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1064377-navid-constantinou) at the [School of Geography, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences][sgseas-site] at the [University of Melbourne][unimelb-site] and also chief investigator at the [ARC Centre of Excellence for the Weather of the 21st Century](https://www.21centuryweather.org.au).

Besides research I enjoy surfing 🏄🏽, biking 🚲, horse riding 🐎, dancing 💃🏼, and photography 📷.
I also like telling stories (science-related or not) and I am an avid story listener.
Whenever I get the chance I hop into the ocean in person.
