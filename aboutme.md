title: About me
#subtitle: Short biographical note
---


I grew up in [Lefkosia][lefkosia-site] and then I headed off to Greece to study physics at the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens][uoa-site]. I obtained my Ph.D. in March 2015 under the supervision of [Petros J. Ioannou][pji-site] on atmospheric dynamics and specifically on the formation of large-scale structures in planetary atmospheres. From September 2015 until April 2018, I worked as a [NOAA Climate & Global Change][noaa-site] postdoctoral fellow with [Bill Young][bill-site] at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography][scripps-site], [University of California San Diego][ucsd-site]. At Scripps I focused on dynamical processes that are at play in the ocean. Then, on May 2018, moved down under at the [Australian National University][anu-site]. I joined the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes][arc-site] as a [Research Fellow][arc-profile] working mainly with [Andy Hogg][andy-site]. On November 2020, I received a [Discovery Early Career Researcher Award][decra2021] from the Australian Research Council to work on machine learning and ocean eddy parametrizations, a project that started on June 2021.

Besides research I enjoy surfing 🏄🏽, biking 🚲, horse riding 🐎, and dancing 💃🏼. I also like telling stories and I am an avid story listener. Whenever I get the chance I hop into the ocean in person.
