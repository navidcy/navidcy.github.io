### Atmosphere and Ocean Dynamics Winter School 2021 (main lecturer along w/ [Annie Foppert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kZ8lBdoAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} and [Martin Singh](http://singh.sci.monash.edu){:target="_blank"})
##### ARC Centre for Climate Extremes, Australian National University
##### June 21-25, 2021

[Winter School website][clexwinterschool2021]{:target="_blank"}.

Syllabus: Basics of atmosphere and ocean dynamics.

### Computational Geosciences (Course Co-Convener along w/ [Louis Moresi](http://www.moresi.info))
#### [Undergraduate/Honors EMSC4033; Masters EMSC8033]
##### Research School of Earth Sciences, Australian National University
##### Semester 1, 2021

Syllabus: Fundamental concepts of computer programming and the Python programming language. Aims include: *(i)* develop students' problem-solving skills; *(ii)* give students a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of computer programming, such that they are in a good position to learn any programming language required for their research; and *(iii)* ensure that all students have core competencies in the Python programming language, which will later be utilized in their research for tasks such as modeling, scripting, analyzing and processing data and generating high-quality figures for presentations and publications.

### Atmosphere and Ocean Dynamics Winter School 2020 (main lecturer along w/ [Annie Foppert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kZ8lBdoAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} and [Martin Singh](http://singh.sci.monash.edu){:target="_blank"})
##### ARC Centre for Climate Extremes, University of Tasmania
##### June 22-26, 2020 (via Zoom due to COVID-19)

Syllabus: Basics of atmosphere and ocean dynamics.

The School had to change format due to COVID-19. There was only a "teaser" version
of the lectures given via Zoom. More info and related material in the [school's Website][clexwinterschool2020]{:target="_blank"}.

 The Slides + Jupyter notebooks reproducing animations that were used in these "teaser" lectures can be found in a [GitHub repository][clexwinterschool2020repo]{:target="_blank"}.
